# Othello Moderator

A Python 3 Othello moderator. To add an AI, write a submodule of the `players` module that contains a subclass of `players.Player`. For the AI to be detected, the class name must be the same as the module name (the filename without the .py extension). A well-tuned AI is included in the `players` module, implemented in both Python and C (much faster and loaded using `ctypes`).

To run the moderator, run `./moderator.py Human AI` where the two arguments are the first and second player types respectively. Optionally, include a `-t` or `-g` argument to specify the type of display.

```
usage: moderator.py [-h] [-g | -t] [players [players ...]]
